I had some experience with Verilog some time ago and now I'm getting familiar VHDL.
I find the book Practical Digital Design: An Introduction to VHDL by Bruce Reidenbach
(Purdue University Press, 2022) to be very helpful.

I'm just starting to use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) also due its better support for
HDL development. I'm used to IntelliJ IDEA but its support for HDL development is not
too great.

I'm using the free TerosHDL extension for VSCode that integrates with a number of
open-source HDL tools like Yosys, GHDL, and Verilator. For GHDL integration, since
I'm working on Windows, I need to install MSYS2 and then download GHDL binary release
for MSYS2 (UCRT64) from https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases.

I'm still working on getting TerosHDL environment in VSCode to work nicely, so stay
tuned.
